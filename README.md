# amiibo-collector

Version 1.0.0

## Summary

A simple web app designed to assist with the collecting of Nintendo's amiibos.

Moreover this app is slowly being refactored to become a general purpose collection app with a long term
goal of being a fully customizable collector's suite. For instance, one day you'll be able to build your
own collection, manage user accounts, etc.
